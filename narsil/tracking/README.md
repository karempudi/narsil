### Tracking Cells




#### Future support

In the future we will provide multiple options to support different kinds of algorithms,
that can be used to perhaps get better results or error corrected tracking results.

Some interesting algorithms we are thinking about are
[Baxter Algorithms](https://github.com/klasma/BaxterAlgorithms) and Graph based approaches that are ranking well on cell-tracking challenge from [KIT](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.16.435631) recently. Or something hybrid and better.
